            <h1>cats</h1>
            <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
                It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often 
                referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
                A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely
                and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their
                ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.

            <h2>Dogs</h2>
            <p>The dog (Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species or Canis lupus
                familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf) is a member of the
                genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is
                the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog
                and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are
                not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated,
                which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. 
                The dog was the first species to be domesticated, and has been
                selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities,
                and physical attributes.

            <h2>Birds</h2>
            <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves,
                characterized by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs,
                a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton.
                Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich.
                There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds.
                Birds have wings whose development varies according to species;
                the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds.
                Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly,
                although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds,
                including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species.
                The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight.
                Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds,
                have further evolved for swimming. </p>
